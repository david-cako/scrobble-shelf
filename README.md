### Create interactive album collages from last.fm scrobble stats.

I wanted a way to integrate my last.fm listening stats with my website that wasn't just a static collage, and didn't require linking out to last.fm.

This python script and accompanying static files allows you to scrape your last.fm listening stats on a regular basis, and insert an interactive array of albums into your website that links back to the albums on last.fm.
